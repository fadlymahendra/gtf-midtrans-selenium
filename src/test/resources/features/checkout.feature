Feature: Login Functionality for OpenCart E-commerce Website

  As a user of the OpenCart website
  I want to be able to log in with my account
  So that I can access my account-related features and manage my orders

  Background:
    Given I am on the Midtrans home page

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When I click on the buy button
    And I click on checkout button
